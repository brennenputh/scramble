# Scramble

Simple CLI binary to scramble text.  Absolutely useless for most purposes, but I figured I may want it to create a puzzle someday.
This is effectively a random substitution cipher.

## Installation

I figure no one will ever want this but myself, so I do not plan to release it on literally anything.  
Clone the repo and run the below in the main directory.
```sh
cargo install --path .
```

## Compiling

Effectively the same as installation.  Binaries in `target/release/`.
```sh 
cargo build --release
```
